<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an IT literate individual with a passion for efficient solutions. I've recently been studing coding as well as
   various other CompTIA certifications to enable myself greater employment opportunities.</p>

<p>I've had ten years in the service and sales industry with customer-facing positions, ranging from sales and events
   management to tattooing and custom jewellery designs, and while I thoroughly enjoy these fields, I've recently been 
   planning on changing to something that will continue to provide me with challenges and improve my standard of living.</p>

<p>
  While this may seem like a radical change, IT and communications have always been a passionate field for me. And with
  my experience in taking on designs and projects from clients in the past, I've got plenty of experience with working 
  around other's time constraints, self-management and going the extra mile because that's the difference between a good
   project, and a great one!</p>
